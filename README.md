# land Use classification #
## Description ##
This project is about how to classify land use image using *Convolutional Neural Network* . Land use data provided by [UC Merced](http://vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html). This project is developed by using [Python3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/), [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org) as a backend and [Keras](http://keras.io/) as high level deep learning library.
Based on dataset, there are 2100 land use images that categorized into 21 classes, so each category has 100 land use images with dimension 256 x 256 pixel. In this project, we will use 85 data for each class as training data and 5 data for each class as testing data, so total 1785 land use images use as training data with 21 class/label and 105 land use images use as testing data with 21 class/label.
